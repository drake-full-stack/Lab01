# Lab 1: Environment Setup

This is the starter repository for Lab 1 of the Full Stack Web Development course. 

## 📌 Steps to Get Started
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/merriekay/full-stack-Lab1
   ```
2. **Navigate into the folder**
   ```bash
   cd full-stack-lab1
   ```

3. **Open in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
   > the `code .` command doesn't always work... sometimes this requires some additional setup. You can also navigate to the folder and open manually.

# 💪 Your Exercises:
1. Modify `index.html` to include more content
2. Update `style.css` with your own styling
3. Commit and push your changes to Github.

# 📊 Grading Scheme (Auto-Graded with GitHub Actions)
